# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs

Utilizing the coinstats API, I dynamically created a table in the DOM then pulled the data from the API response to plug the needed infromation into each row of the table. The app then checks the data values to see if it is a positive or negative change, dynamically adding the table cells to a CSS class list that corresponds to positive(green) or negative(red) backgrounds to more easily visualize the provided data. 

# Lessons Learned:
Through this project I was able to learn even more about dynamic rendering and and API utilization. I also learned how important it can be to adapt an original design to meet the potentially unforeseen needs of the data being utilized.
